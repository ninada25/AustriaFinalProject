# Final Project - Wordle!

My final project for CMSC 140 is a version of the Wordle game where users have 10 chances to guess a 5-letter word. After each incorrect guess, the program tells the user how many letters they have in the right position and how many letters they have that are in the word but in the wrong position; it does not tell the user exactly which letters they have in the right or wrong position.

The random module was used to create my project. Additionally, I copied and pasted the first 1000 words from https://github.com/charlesreid1/five-letter-words/blob/master/sgb-words.txt into a file called 'words.txt' and read in this file; I then had my program select a random word from the file.

I worked on this project individually, so I wrote all functions, conditional statements, loops, and lists, processed external files and user input, ensured that my project was free of errors and that it handled user-input errors gracefully, and added useful comments throughout my program.
